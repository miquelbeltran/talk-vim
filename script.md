Introduction


Hello everyone! I'm Miguel Beltran, most of you already know me, I've been
and Android developer for many years, but recently since the begining of
this year I became a freelancer, so if you are looking into going freelance
or similar, come chat with me.

But today I will be talking Vim, or better said, IdeaVim, not as an app or tool
but more like as a useful skill that you can learn and use everyday.


My goal with this talk, is that you see the benefits of using Vim and IdeaVim
and at the same time, that you lose your fear to start using it.

One of the first reasons I like vim is becasue I prefer to avoid the mouse
usage. Have you noticed that when you are traveling, and try to use the trackpad
sometimes you will get taps and clicks you didn't want, like when there's a
bump on the road.

I also like to use it for writing commits when using git via commandline.

And of course to edit any kind of file in the terminal doesn't matter if
locally or when connecting remotely.

The best thing is that with IdeaVim, you can have the same advantages you have
with Vim but on Android Studio or any other editor that supports the vi-mode.

You can record and play macros on the fly. And let me show you a video that
showcases it. In this example is just a simple macro recorded directly in
the editor using key presses, and then played again, which is super powerful.

It also supports lots and lots of plugins, like you have here decades of
people creating really awesome plugins of anything you may need.

And of course, you will feel like a hacker! So why not?
